# Data

Data in DRT is defined as blob of information (bits/bytes) that is valuable to a human being. Data must be identifiable (atleast approximately, to best effort), recognisable, and useful.

Data is really composed of two parts, its metadata and the information itself. The metadata identifies the data entity. And cannot be changed by thansformations, and is only defined and undefined by the source. The information, or the blobs that actually compose the data are subject to transformation.

Examples of data may be: A word document, a photograph, an mp3 song.

# Blob

Initially all data starts out as one blob, describing the whole data. As given to computer system by the user. And everything else that shall happen to this blob is a transformation.

Each blob must be associated with a medium. A blob also has a known location within the medium a location is defined by the offset.

A blobs origin is either the source, or some transformation.

# Medium

At any time, data should be associated to a medium. A medium is where the data is stored or travels through, it is its location. A medium is the entity in DRT whose integrity may become violated. It is important to note that data is not damaged, the medium the data is in is. The assumption is however that while integirty of the medium cannot be guaranteed, the medium is in part (possible whole) is available for the data recovery process.

A medium is a container for one or more pieces of data, the data may be spread over multiple mediums. And for the purposes of recovery process a medium is always treated as a blob.

A medium can be various, a hard disk, a file, a database, a storage cluster, a network connection, a buffer, RAM, what the medium is depends on the use case of the data.


# Source

Data always comes from a source, this source is ultimately the user, the human, whose data is important, who holds the motivation to recovery it. DRT is not feasible to be generated by a human, and human doesnt neccessarly know what happens to his data once it enters the digital world.

The one who knows is the application, the application that interfaces with a human and is the first entity in the computer world that gets to see the data. This application could be a database for storing patients data, photo management software for photographers, camera app on the phone, SMB server and etc. This application in DRT is defined as the source.

The application knows what the data is, and where it what it does with this data next. This data may be valuable to the user, and the application will ultimately store, transfer or discard it.

In the process of storing or transfering the data transformations must be utilised.

# Transformer

Transformer is anything that takes the original data and changes it. Usually in terms of format of the blob. It may convert the data intelligently, understanding what the data is or equally unintellegently, simply operating on it a blob of information. The transformation is arbitrary and is entirely up to the transformer.

# Transformation

In general however a transformation takes an input and produces an output. For a transformation in DRT part of an input (possibly whole) must be some portion (possibly whole) of the data, along with other inputs. An output may be one of either forms: the transformed data, or nothing. In the case of nothing the transformation is a discard operation. A transformation must be pure.

A transformation may be reversible or irreversible. A reversible transformation must define an inverse operation that given input consisting atleast of the portion of output (possibly whole) of the forward transformation, would yield the original data (given as input to the forward transformation).

An irreversible transformation implies loss of data, an irreversible transformation may be useful on its own. As its own piece of data. For example if a PNG is converted to JPEG to optimise the storage requirements, the JPEG cannot be converted to the original, the data is lost, however in most cases to a human being a JPEG is better than nothing.

For the purposes of recovery the forward transformation is not that interesting for reversible transformations. For irreversible ones it is still useful in the case where an inverse transformation could be identified later on.
